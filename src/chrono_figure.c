THE CHRONO FIGURE ADDRESS SPACE

The easiest way to interface with the USB code appears to be to pretend to be a
memory. We have our own space (USBINT_SERVER_SPACE_CHRONO_FIGURE), so we set it
up so that executing PUT and GET opcodes over the USB interface calls
cf_writeblock and cf_readblock.

The address space is very 32-bit little endian, so only 32-bit reads and writes
are supported to 32-bit aligned addresses. However, cf_writeblock and
cf_readblock have to emulate this for byte accesses. This has some
considerations outlined below.

For cf_readblock, there is a 32-bit word cache which stores the last accessed
word and its word address. If a new access happens to a different word address,
the cache is loaded with that new word and any read side effects take place.

For cf_writeblock, there is another 32-bit word cache which stores the last
written word, its word address, and which bytes within were written. Once all
four bytes have been written, the write is performed and any write side effects
take place. If a different word address is written to, or if any write is
performed, the cache is cleared and the data is forgotten.

The functions are designed so that reading and writing linearly, even in weird
sized chunks, works as expected. "Linearly" being that the address of the next
operation is the address of the previous operation + the amount of bytes
operated on in that operation. This is how the USB code uses it.

The address space is as follows. Writes to addresses not listed or not available
for writing have no effect. Reads from addresses not listed or not available for
reading return zero.
0x00000000 (R  ): gateware version

0x00000004 (R/W): loopback register (reads as the last value written)

0x00000008 (  W): reset control. write nonzero to assert console reset or zero
                  to deassert. the sd2snes will not notice the reset so e.g.
                  SRAM will not be saved. cleared on ROM load.

0x0000000C (  W): save inhibit. write nonzero to stop the sd2snes from saving
                  save RAM. write zero to re-enable saving and force one save.
                  cleared on ROM load.

0x00000010 (  W): save RAM clear. write 0x05C1EA12 to clear save RAM (set all
                  bytes to 0xFF). may have "exciting" effects if not in reset.

0x10000000 (  W): matcher config registers. currently there is one word per
 -1FFFFFFF        matcher and 256 words mapped in the space (but not necessarily
                  256 matchers), with the rest as mirrors.

0x80000000 (R  ): event FIFO. reading any address returns the next word from the
 -8FFFFFFF        FIFO. if the high bit is set, then the FIFO was empty and the
                  word is invalid.
